# Image Compressor and Converter

## Description

This is a simple Python application built with **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **Pillow** (PIL) for image processing. The application enables users to:

- Compress images by adjusting the quality.
- Convert images to PNG format.

This project was developed to meet the needs of a friend studying at an art school, who had difficulty executing these tasks on their computer. The tool simplifies the process by providing an easy-to-use GUI to compress and convert images without the need for technical knowledge.

## Features

- **Compress Images**: Compress images by selecting a quality level (from 1 to 100). A higher quality results in lower compression.
- **Convert Images to PNG**: Convert images from various formats to PNG with ease.

## Requirements

To run this application, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included with Python by default)
- Pillow (can be installed via pip)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 

- Navigate to the project directory
- Install the required dependencies
  pip install pillow


## Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal
python app.py

- The application will open a simple GUI with two buttons:

- Compress an Image: Select an image and specify the desired quality (1-100) to compress it.
- Convert to PNG: Choose an image to convert it to PNG format.
- After selecting an image, the tool will process it and save the result in the same folder.
